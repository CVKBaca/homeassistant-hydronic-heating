# Hydronic Heating for Home Assistant

A set of Home Assistant blueprints for controlling hydronic (hot water) heating systems with **Shelly TRV** thermostatic radiator valves and a gas/oil boiler.

The system implements **proportional valve control** — instead of simple on/off, each radiator valve opens proportionally to the temperature deficit. The boiler is controlled automatically based on actual heating demand.

---

## ⚠️ Important Safety Requirement

**At least one radiator in the hydraulic circuit must remain permanently open** (manually set, not controlled by this system).

If all radiators close simultaneously, the boiler and circulation pump will push water into a closed circuit — this can damage or destroy your equipment.

`*` `heating_apply_mode` is a plain automation (not a blueprint) — see [docs/heating-schedule.md](docs/heating-schedule.md).

One `shelly_trv_controller` instance per TRV. One instance each of `hydronic_boiler_controller`, `hydronic_heating_schedule`, and `hydronic_presence_controller`.

For an 11-TRV installation: **11 + 3 = 14 automation instances**.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the blueprints, create the following entities manually. See [docs/prerequisites.md](docs/prerequisites.md) for detailed instructions.

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `binary_sensor.thermostat_*` | YAML Template Sensor | `true` when valve position > 18% (room needs heat) |
| `sensor.heating_status` | UI Template Sensor | Returns `On`/`Off` based on outdoor temperature / season |
| `input_number.*_current` | Input Number | Target temperature per room, controllable from UI |

---

## Blueprints

### 1. Shelly TRV Controller

**File:** `blueprints/shelly_trv_controller.yaml`

**Logic:**
- **Valve position:** Computes `delta = target_temp − room_temp`, maps to 0–100% via a proportional lookup table, sends MQTT `valve_pos` command when position differs by ≥5% (hysteresis). Protects against boiler short-cycling.
- **Temperature sync:** Sends room temperature to the TRV via MQTT `ext_t` (overrides the TRV's internal sensor, which reads high due to valve motor heat).
- **Target temperature:** Sets TRV target via MQTT `target_t` when `input_number` changes. Supports window/door sensor for frost protection.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `trv_entity` | ✅ | — | Climate entity of the Shelly TRV |
| `aqara_sensor` | ✅ | — | External room temperature sensor (Aqara or similar) |
| `trv_temperature_sensor` | ✅ | — | TRV's built-in temperature sensor |
| `current_valve_entity` | ✅ | — | `number.shelly_trv_*_valve_position` |
| `target_temp_input` | ✅ | — | `input_number` with desired room temperature |
| `mqtt_topic_base` | ✅ | — | Base MQTT topic (e.g. `shellies/shellytrv_bedroom_1/thermostat/0/command`) |
| `window_sensor` | ⬜ | `sun.sun` | Window/door sensor for frost protection |
| `frost_temp` | ⬜ | `8` | Frost temperature when window is open (°C) |
| `heating_status_sensor` | ⬜ | `sensor.heating_status` | Heating season sensor |
| `boiler_sensor` | ⬜ | `binary_sensor.protherm_24` | Boiler sensor for short-cycling protection |
| `window_close_delay` | ⬜ | `5` | Minutes to wait after window closes before restoring temperature |

---

### 2. Hydronic Boiler Controller

**File:** `blueprints/hydronic_boiler_controller.yaml`

Controls the boiler based on aggregate heating demand from all rooms. Handles both turn-on and turn-off logic in a single automation instance.

**Turn ON logic:**
- Triggers immediately when any thermostat sensor turns `on`
- Includes short-cycling protection: waits until the boiler has been stable for `min_cycle_protection` minutes before switching on
- Does not turn on outside the heating season

**Turn OFF logic:**
- Triggers after all thermostat sensors have been `off` for `turn_off_delay` minutes (delay is built into the trigger — no unnecessary pumping)
- If any thermostat turns on during the delay, the off-timer resets automatically (`mode: restart`)

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `boiler_switch` | ✅ | — | Switch entity controlling the boiler |
| `boiler_sensor` | ✅ | — | Binary sensor reflecting actual boiler state |
| `thermostat_sensors` | ✅ | — | List of `binary_sensor.thermostat_*` entities |
| `heating_status_sensor` | ⬜ | `sensor.heating_status` | Heating season sensor |
| `min_cycle_protection` | ⬜ | `10` | Minutes since last boiler state change before allowing turn-on |
| `turn_off_delay` | ⬜ | `10` | Minutes all thermostats must be off before turning off the boiler |

---

### 3. Hydronic Heating Schedule

**File:** `blueprints/hydronic_heating_schedule.yaml`

Switches `input_select.heating_mode` between Morning / Day / Evening / Night based on time of day and presence. Evening is triggered at sunset with a configurable offset.

When someone arrives home, the correct mode is automatically determined from the current time — no manual intervention needed.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `heating_mode_entity` | ✅ | — | `input_select` with Morning/Day/Evening/Night options |
| `person_group` | ✅ | — | `group` entity for presence detection |
| `morning_time` | ⬜ | `06:00:00` | Time to switch to Morning mode |
| `day_time` | ⬜ | `07:00:00` | Time to switch to Day mode |
| `evening_offset` | ⬜ | `00:00:00` | Offset from sunset (e.g. `-00:30:00` = 30 min before sunset) |
| `night_time` | ⬜ | `22:00:00` | Time to switch to Night mode |

> **Collision protection:** If `sunset ± evening_offset` falls outside the window between `day_time` and `night_time`, the Evening mode switch is silently skipped. Make sure your offset does not push the Evening trigger before Day time or after Night time.

### 4. Hydronic Presence Controller

**File:** `blueprints/hydronic_presence_controller.yaml`

Controls `input_select.heating_mode` and domestic hot water based on household presence. Handles Away mode (immediate), Holiday mode (after configurable hours away), and automatic mode restoration on return.

Also manages hot water: turns it off when everyone leaves, back on when someone returns, and provides a midnight safety off (00:00) and morning re-enable (06:00).

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `person_group` | ✅ | — | `group` entity for household presence |
| `heating_mode_entity` | ✅ | — | `input_select.heating_mode` |
| `hot_water_switch` | ✅ | — | Switch controlling hot water (inverted: ON = stopped) |
| `hot_water_input_sensor` | ✅ | — | Binary sensor for physical override input |
| `holiday_threshold_hours` | ⬜ | `18` | Hours away before switching to Holiday mode |

See [docs/presence-control.md](docs/presence-control.md) for full details including hot water wiring and mode interaction.
